# Backend Development Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the backend development process for a full-stack web application. The backend is built using Node.js and Express and integrates with the Sleeper API for NFL data. It includes user authentication, session management, and CRUD operations for various entities.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- **Express**: Web application framework for Node.js, used for building the web API.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database system for storing user data, player rankings, drafts, and other relevant data.
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework used for writing unit and integration tests.
- **Supertest**: Library for testing HTTP assertions, used in conjunction with Jest.
- **bcryptjs**: Library for hashing and comparing passwords for user authentication.
- **jsonwebtoken (JWT)**: Implementation of JSON Web Tokens for user authentication and session management.
- **Sleeper API**: External API for fetching NFL players' data.

## Backend Features

### User Authentication
- **Registration**: Allows new users to register with a username, email, and password.
- **Login**: Authenticates users and provides a JWT for session management.

### API Integration
- **Sleeper API**: Integrated to fetch and store NFL players' data. Handles data synchronization and updates.

### CRUD Operations
- **Players**: Retrieve all players, specific player details, and update player data.
- **Drafts**: Create, read, update, and delete draft information.
- **Rankings**: Manage player rankings with the ability to add, retrieve, update, and remove rankings.

### Database Schema
- PostgreSQL database with tables for users, players, drafts, and rankings.
- Relations and constraints set up to maintain data integrity.

### Testing and Debugging
- Comprehensive testing of backend routes using Jest and Supertest.
- Mocking of database interactions and authentication middleware for isolated testing.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **API Data Integration**: Managed the large data set from the Sleeper API and resolved data format discrepancies.
- **Authentication**: Implemented secure user authentication and token-based session management.
- **Data Schema Design**: Designed a relational database schema that efficiently handles complex data relationships.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling for API routes to ensure stability and reliability.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand the test suite to cover more edge cases and error scenarios.
- Implement additional features based on user feedback and application requirements.
- Optimize performance for handling larger datasets and higher user loads.
